# ActorsApp
This is my first application. It is targeted for Android, but is written, using cross-platfrom library, JUCE.
Purpose of application is:
* To extract data from themoviedb.org,
* To show extracted data as a list,
* To count number of people with first name give.
# How to use it?
First thing you see at startup is main menu, consisting three buttons: Show List, Show Search, Update DB. When you use the application for the first time, you would need to update(download) database in order to be able to use other functions. Also, you need internet connection for Show List functionality, because it downloads photos of actors interactively.
